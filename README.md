# Stellar-Sortie
Too big to upload to scratch.mit.edu :P

There are still bugs in the game.
I ripped the music and sounds from Star Command, the game that inspired this one.
You can play Star Command @ https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/54013618/
Please note that Star Command is 5 years old now.

Please enjoy...

STELLAR SORTIE! (But like imagine it in large ASCII text.)
