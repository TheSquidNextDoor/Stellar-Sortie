# Stellar-Sortie
Too big to upload to scratch.mit.edu :P

There are still bugs in the game.
I ripped the music and sounds from Star Command, the game that inspired this one.
You can play Star Command @ https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/54013618/
Please note that Star Command is 5 years old now.

Please enjoy...

STELLAR SORTIE! (But like imagine it in large ASCII text.)

WASD (Or arrow keys) to move.
Mouse to aim.
E for space drag
Q to shoot.


CHANGELOG!

V1.1:

Added boss type enemy called "The Juggernaut", the first multi-entity enemy in the game. (The Rift-Class Stealth ship is the first multi-entity ship in the game.)
Added HUD marker for The Juggernaut.
Increased acceleration of the Torpedo Boat and the MAC Battleship. (The latter is still hard-countered by The Juggernaut though.)
Fixed incorrect hit sfx playing.
Nerfed MK II Pirate Interceptor damage.
Added spawn conditions for The Juggernaut.
I still need to fix Siphon mission type.
Need to add boat enemies for Sol III's mission.
Need to add mission hazards.
Need to add actual tutorial(?).
