!!!THIS GAME IS BEING PORTED TO UNITY!!!



Section 1: Introduction

  Welcome! Check back on the github (https://github.com/TheSquidNextDoor/Stellar-Sortie) for updates! (Usually every week.)
  
  Too big to upload to scratch.mit.edu :P

  There are still bugs in the game.
  I ripped the music and sounds from Star Command, the game that inspired this one.
  You can play Star Command @ https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/54013618/
  Please note that Star Command is 5 years old now.
  All artwork is owned and drawn by me.

  Please enjoy...

  STELLAR SORTIE! (But like imagine it in large ASCII text.)
  (Formerly known as Space Geam.)

  Also, there's a discord server for the game.

Section 2: Controls

  Subsection 1: Keboard + Mouse Ctrl. Scheme
    
   {W}, {A}, {S}, {D} or the Arrow Keys are used to move your spaceship relative to its direction.
   You can press {E} to toggle Automatic Slowdown. If you turn it off you can achieve your maximum speed.
   A word of warning however, turning off Auto. Slowdown makes your ship behave as if it was actually in space.
   There is no delay with toggling it however. Auto. Slowdown also allows you to keep moving when you let go of
   a movement key. Keep this in mind!
   To shot your ship's weaponry, press {Q}. You need to do this in order to not die*. (* If you die, you achieve a state of 
   failure.)
   
   Subsection 2: Keyboard Ctrl. Scheme
   
   The Keyboard Only control (ctrl.) scheme controls almost exactly the same as Keyboard + Mouse with 1 major difference: You 
   can't straife (move sideways.).
   
   Subsection 3: Mouse/touchscreen Ctrl. Scheme
   
   To move in this, you click/tap and hold where you want to go. When you click/tap in the play space, your ship points
   towards where you clicked/tapped. When you click/tap and hold, you start moving in that direction. To shoot your ship's
   weaponry, you click/tap the button on your Heads Up Display (HUD) labled "FIRE". To disable auto-slowdown, press the button
   on your HUD labeled "Space Drag".

Section 3: Squid's Sub-par Survival Guide!
  
  Subsection 3a: Survival Guide

    1. Know your enemy! Enemies that shoot you will orbit you when they go to attack.
    2. Learn to lead your shots! (Aim where the target is going to be, not where they are. There are no hitscan weapons here.)
    3. Observe your surroundings! A non-observant pilot is useless in the heat of battle.
    4. If you encounter the Marauder MK II or the Juggernaut, avoid them at all costs if you aren't good enough to destroy them. 
    5. Learn to orbit your target when attacking them! You can turn while moving sideways.
    
    Now go out there and junk some pirates!
    
  Subsection 3b: General tips 'n' tricks.
    In no particular order.
      
      1. The green circle in the centre of your screen is how far you can see.
      2. The red dots on your screen are a reading of where your enemies are relative to you.
      3. You can't shoot offscreen enemies due to a thing called *arbitrary gun range*.
      4. The Marauder MK II is powerful and the Juggernaut is even more so. Avoid them until you can reliably take them on
         and survive.
      5. Don't touch the damaged wires.
      6. Everything that shoots in this game shoots a projectile. There's no hitscan weaponry. Lead your shots.
      7. Bigger isn't always better! No ship shouldn't be overlooked because of its size!
      8. The ships are ordered in terms of size.

Section 4: CHANGELOG! (The place where I list the changes I made to the game.)

  V1.1:

  Added boss type enemy called "The Juggernaut", the first multi-entity enemy in the game. (The Rift-Class Stealth ship is the    
  first multi-entity ship in the game.)
  Added HUD marker for The Juggernaut.
  Increased acceleration of the Torpedo Boat and the MAC Battleship. (The latter is still soft-countered by The Juggernaut 
  though.)
  Fixed incorrect hit sfx playing.
  Nerfed MK II Pirate Interceptor damage.
  Added red trail for MK II Interceptor projectile.
  Added spawn conditions for The Juggernaut.
  I still need to fix Siphon mission type.
  Need to add boat enemies for Sol III's mission.
  Need to add mission hazards.
  Need to add actual tutorial(?).
  
  V1.2
  
  Added mission select screen for more customisation! (Note: Only Survival, Elimination and Siphon work as of now.)
  Changed background to be more realistic. Don't worry, the stars still have colours!
  Fixed Siphon mission type.
  Don't touch the wires.
  Removed water mission for now. (Will return later!)
  Added new particle effect for armour piercing munitions.
  Piercing shots no longer create an explosion for every frame they're inside an enemy.
  Fixed leaky fuel line with duct tape. Will need a new pipe before the fix breaks.
  Piercing shots now make a "hull breach" particle when they first hit an enenemy but still cause constant dmg for every frame
  they're in contact with an enemy.
  Removed preset missions for each planet.

  V1.3
  
  Added "Extreme Heat" Hazard.
  Extreme Heat makes you have to deal with your ship's heat. (Only for that mission hazard though.)
  Mission select now comes before planet select.
  Fixed background object layering issues.
  Added Escort mission type.
  Siphon isn't actually fixed.
  Fixed mugshot positioning.
  Juggernaut no longer moves without its thruster.
  Juggernaut thruster HP massively lowered.
  Added Point Defence weapons to Juggernaut.

  REX still doesn't want you touching the wires.
  Added 100% more eldritch horrors.
  Improved usability.
  And probably some more stuff I forgot.
  
  V1.31
  
  Added mission boundary line to visually show where the mission boundaries are.
  Added arrow to direct you back in-bounds when you go OOB. (Out of bounds.)
  
  V1.4
  
  Added 2nd boss enemy, the Marauder MK II.
  Added visual alerts to HUD when bosses spawn and difficulty increases.
  Difficulty increases every 2 minutes after 5 minutes in survival.
  Added enemy dialouge to denote their current state.
  Enemies can be in 5 states: Idle, Alerted, In combat, Getting damaged and Being Dead. (These only affect the dialouge from them.)
  Added cracks on the player's HUD for when they take damage.
  Massively cleaned up the HUD.
  MK II Interceptor only spawns when the player plays survival for >5 minutes.
  Enemies now have increased health past a certain difficulty level.
  Buffed Combat Mech.
  Did you touch the wires? No? Good.
  Fixed some layering issues for background objects.
  Added new background objects.

  V1.5

  Relabled every playable ship
  Removed PD turret holes from Railgun Corvette (Formally the MAC Battleship)
  Added particle effect for when the player's shields are depleted
  Changed ship and planet selection buttons to be a lot more obvious
  If you're wondering, the 'C' in the C class interceptor means Classic because the Prototype Corvette is the first non-placeholder ship made for the game. (There's some trivia for you.)
  Also, my personal preference is the Protoype Corvette
  You can now go back to ship selection and not be greeted with a visual mess
  Changed position of start mission button
  Kamakazi Drones no longer heal you (I got some math wrong.)
  
  V1.6

  Title Screen has been updated to include the new spacecraft that were added before it.
  Title Screen has been updated to show Neptune instead of Saturn.

  (Hopefully) fixed enemies drifting when approaching the player.
  I still don't really like the MK I C Class Interceptor.
  Enemies now attack the Siphon and Escort Target.
  Fixed sprites of MK I & II C Class Interceptors.
  Started work on a bomber ship.
  Added moons to Earth and Mars.
  Overhauled visual design of system map. Planet sprites are used now.
  The Alien Forge-World now appears when playing at neptune.
  Alien Forge-World now available as a locale.
  Neptune nown appears when playing at the Alien Forge-World.
  Added alien drone enemies for Alien Forge-World.
  (The assets for the alien drones & planet have been in the game since the release build btw.)

  V1.7
  
  Added boss enemy for the Alien Forge-world.
  Added boss variant of the Alien Carrier for Neptune.
  Rebalanced spawn priority for Alien Forge-World enemies.
  High-tier Alien ships now spawn more often at higher difficulties.
  Finally implemented the Riftbound Adversary (RbA). (Now with a new look! The old sprite was the R class interceptor but purple-ish.)
  RbA will show up on the Alien Forge-World and Neptune. (@ high difficulties.)
  Changed Earth sprite to be less green.
  Added armour system. (A universal health measurement that can be restored via pickups.)
  Enemies now have a 15% chance to drop armour pickups that restore 10% armour when picked up on death.
  Buffed Enemy C Class Interceptor's damage.
  Added armour repair pickups.
  Realised the Railgun Corvette is pretty tanky.
  Dev says the game is almost complete.
  Added more Evangelion references.

  V1.8
  Fixed readme screen.

  Added several reminders to read the readme.
  Removed the outdated quickstart guide.
  New mechanic: Score system!
    Kill things to earn score. Kill things fast to earn more score.
    Complete your mission for a score multiplier!
    Score is tracked up the top of your HUD.
      Time bonus is calculated differently for endurance mission types. (Survival, Escort and Siphon. Survival gib more bonus the longer you, well... survive. Sihpon
      and Escord gib bonus on how long you take to escort or finish siphoning plus some additional time because it's nigh impossible to pull of a perfect
      escort/sihpon. Assassination has larger time windows because bosses are very durable.) All non-endurance missions have their time bonus scaled for difficulty.
      
      Final score is calculated with this formula: (((MissionScore + SurvivalBonus + (EnemiesDestroyed * 10)) + TimeBonus + DamageDealt) - DamageTaken) * BestCombo
      TLDR: Big combo + fast mission + lods of kills = Big score. (The in-mission counter goes up to 9,999,999 btw.)
      
  Increased speed for all player shots. Should be easier to hit your shots with torpedoes.
  Added sound for getting hurt at low/no armour.
  Your mum is no longer gay.
  Added PINGAS sound effect because why the [REDACTED] not?  
  Changed mission end screen to show score.
  (Hopefully) Added ability to go straight from end screen to hangar without restarting the game.
  Changed mugshot to be more detailed.
  Changed space drag indicator to more clearly show if it's on or not.
