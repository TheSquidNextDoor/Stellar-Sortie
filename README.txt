Section 1: Introduction

  Stellar-Sortie
  Too big to upload to scratch.mit.edu :P

  There are still bugs in the game.
  I ripped the music and sounds from Star Command, the game that inspired this one.
  You can play Star Command @ https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/54013618/
  Please note that Star Command is 5 years old now.

  Please enjoy...

  STELLAR SORTIE! (But like imagine it in large ASCII text.)



Section 2: Controls

  Subsection 1: Keboard + Mouse Ctrl. Scheme
    
   {W}, {A}, {S}, {D} or the Arrow Keys are used to move your spaceship relative to its direction.
   You can press {E} to toggle Automatic Slowdown. If you turn it off you can achieve your maximum speed.
   To shot your ship's weaponry, press {Q}. You need to do this in order to not die*. (* If you die, you achieve a state of 
   failure.
   
   Subsection 2: Keyboard Ctrl. Scheme
   
   The Keyboard Only control (ctrl.) scheme controls almost exactly the same as Keyboard + Mouse with 1 major difference: You 
   can't straife (move sideways.).
   
   Subsection 3: Mouse/touchscreen Ctrl. Scheme
   
   To move in this, you click/tap and hold where you want to go. When you click/tap in the play space, your ship points
   towards where you clicked/tapped. When you click/tap and hold, you start moving in that direction. To shoot your ship's
   weaponry, you click/tap the button on your Heads Up Display (HUD) labled "FIRE". To disable auto-slowdown, press the button
   on your HUD labeled "Space Drag".




Section 3: CHANGELOG!

  V1.1:

  Added boss type enemy called "The Juggernaut", the first multi-entity enemy in the game. (The Rift-Class Stealth ship is the    
  first multi-entity ship in the game.)
  Added HUD marker for The Juggernaut.
  Increased acceleration of the Torpedo Boat and the MAC Battleship. (The latter is still soft-countered by The Juggernaut 
  though.)
  Fixed incorrect hit sfx playing.
  Nerfed MK II Pirate Interceptor damage.
  Added red trail for MK II Interceptor projectile.
  Added spawn conditions for The Juggernaut.
  I still need to fix Siphon mission type.
  Need to add boat enemies for Sol III's mission.
  Need to add mission hazards.
  Need to add actual tutorial(?).
  
  V1.2
  
  Added mission select screen for more customisation! (Note: Only Survival, Elimination and Siphon work as of now.)
  Changed background to be more realistic. Don't worry, the stars still have colours!
  Fixed Siphon mission type.
  Don't touch the wires.
  Removed water mission for now. (Will return later!)
  Added new particle effect for armour piercing munitions.
  Piercing shots no longer create an explosion for every frame they're inside an enemy.
  Fixed leaky fuel line with duct tape. Will need a new pipe before the fix breaks.
  Piercing shots now make a "hull breach" particle when they first hit an enenemy but still cause constant dmg for every frame
  they're in contact with an enemy.
  Removed preset missions for each planet.
