Section 1: Introduction

  Welcome! Check back on the github (https://github.com/TheSquidNextDoor/Stellar-Sortie) for updates! (Usually every week.)
  
  Too big to upload to scratch.mit.edu :P

  There are still bugs in the game.
  I ripped the music and sounds from Star Command, the game that inspired this one.
  You can play Star Command @ https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/54013618/
  Please note that Star Command is 5 years old now.
  All artwork is owned and drawn by me.

  Please enjoy...

  STELLAR SORTIE! (But like imagine it in large ASCII text.)

  Also, there's a discord server for the game.

Section 2: Quickstart Guide
  
  This section is a guide to actually start a mission.
  
  Step 1. Open "Stellar Sortie V(Version number).exe"
  Step 2. Wait for the game to load. (It's loaded when the application makes noise.)
  Step 3. Click/tap/admire the title screen.
  Step 4. Click the blue arrows at the top-left of the screen to select the spacecraft you want to pilot.
  Step 5. Click the pink button at the bottom-right of the screen that reads "Mission Select".
  Step 6. Optional. Inspect the mission select screen.
  Step 7. Click one of the buttons at the centre of the screen that have text on them.
  (Note: Only Survival and Elimination work as of V1.2.)
  Step 8. Select the planet you want to deploy to with the blue arrows.
  Step 9. Click the blue button at the bottom of the screen that reads "Select planet".
  Step 10. Profit.




Section 3: Controls

  Subsection 1: Keboard + Mouse Ctrl. Scheme
    
   {W}, {A}, {S}, {D} or the Arrow Keys are used to move your spaceship relative to its direction.
   You can press {E} to toggle Automatic Slowdown. If you turn it off you can achieve your maximum speed.
   A word of warning however, turning off Auto. Slowdown makes your ship behave as if it was actually in space.
   There is no delay with toggling it however. Auto. Slowdown also allows you to keep moving when you let go of
   a movement key. Keep this in mind!
   To shot your ship's weaponry, press {Q}. You need to do this in order to not die*. (* If you die, you achieve a state of 
   failure.)
   
   Subsection 2: Keyboard Ctrl. Scheme
   
   The Keyboard Only control (ctrl.) scheme controls almost exactly the same as Keyboard + Mouse with 1 major difference: You 
   can't straife (move sideways.).
   
   Subsection 3: Mouse/touchscreen Ctrl. Scheme
   
   To move in this, you click/tap and hold where you want to go. When you click/tap in the play space, your ship points
   towards where you clicked/tapped. When you click/tap and hold, you start moving in that direction. To shoot your ship's
   weaponry, you click/tap the button on your Heads Up Display (HUD) labled "FIRE". To disable auto-slowdown, press the button
   on your HUD labeled "Space Drag".

Section 4: Squid's Sub-par Survival Guide!
  
  Subsection 4a: Survival Guide

    1. Know your enemy! Enemies that shoot you will orbit you when they go to attack.
    2. Learn to lead your shots! (Aim where the target is going to be, not where they are. There are no hitscan weapons here.)
    3. Observe your surroundings! A non-observant pilot is useless in the heat of battle.
    4. If you encounter the Marauder MK II or the Juggernaut, avoid them at all costs if you aren't good enough to destroy them. 
    5. Learn to orbit your target when attacking them! You can turn while moving sideways.
    
    Now go out there and junk some pirates!
    
  Subsection 4b: General tips 'n' tricks.
    In no particular order.
      
      1. The green circle in the centre of your screen is how far you can see.
      2. The red dots on your screen are a reading of where your enemies are relative to you.
      3. You can't shoot offscreen enemies due to a thing called *arbitrary gun range*.
      4. The Marauder MK II is powerful and the Juggernaut is even more so. Avoid them until you can reliably take them on
         and survive.
      5. Don't touch the damaged wires.
      6. Everything that shoots in this game shoots a projectile. There's no hitscan weaponry. Lead your shots.
      7. Bigger isn't always better! No ship shouldn't be overlooked because of its size!
      8. The ships are ordered in terms of size.

Section 5: CHANGELOG! (The place where I list the changes I made to the game.)

  V1.1:

  Added boss type enemy called "The Juggernaut", the first multi-entity enemy in the game. (The Rift-Class Stealth ship is the    
  first multi-entity ship in the game.)
  Added HUD marker for The Juggernaut.
  Increased acceleration of the Torpedo Boat and the MAC Battleship. (The latter is still soft-countered by The Juggernaut 
  though.)
  Fixed incorrect hit sfx playing.
  Nerfed MK II Pirate Interceptor damage.
  Added red trail for MK II Interceptor projectile.
  Added spawn conditions for The Juggernaut.
  I still need to fix Siphon mission type.
  Need to add boat enemies for Sol III's mission.
  Need to add mission hazards.
  Need to add actual tutorial(?).
  
  V1.2
  
  Added mission select screen for more customisation! (Note: Only Survival, Elimination and Siphon work as of now.)
  Changed background to be more realistic. Don't worry, the stars still have colours!
  Fixed Siphon mission type.
  Don't touch the wires.
  Removed water mission for now. (Will return later!)
  Added new particle effect for armour piercing munitions.
  Piercing shots no longer create an explosion for every frame they're inside an enemy.
  Fixed leaky fuel line with duct tape. Will need a new pipe before the fix breaks.
  Piercing shots now make a "hull breach" particle when they first hit an enenemy but still cause constant dmg for every frame
  they're in contact with an enemy.
  Removed preset missions for each planet.

  V1.3
  
  Added "Extreme Heat" Hazard.
  Extreme Heat makes you have to deal with your ship's heat. (Only for that mission hazard though.)
  Mission select now comes before planet select.
  Fixed background object layering issues.
  Added Escort mission type.
  Siphon isn't actually fixed.
  Fixed mugshot positioning.
  Juggernaut no longer moves without its thruster.
  Juggernaut thruster HP massively lowered.
  Added Point Defence weapons to Juggernaut.
  Added new HUD effect for overheating.
  REX still doesn't want you touching the wires.
  Added 100% more eldritch horrors.
  Improved usability.
  And probably some more stuff I forgot.
  
  V1.31
  
  Added mission boundary line to visually show where the mission boundaries are.
  Added arrow to direct you back in-bounds when you go OOB. (Out of bounds.)
  
  V1.4
  
  Added 2nd boss enemy, the Marauder MK II.
  Added visual alerts to HUD when bosses spawn and difficulty increases.
  Difficulty increases every 2 minutes after 5 minutes in survival.
  Added enemy dialouge to denote their current state.
  Enemies can be in 5 states: Idle, Alerted, In combat, Getting damaged and Being Dead. (These only affect the dialouge from them.)
  Added cracks on the player's HUD for when they take damage.
  Massively cleaned up the HUD.
  MK II Interceptor only spawns when the player plays survival for >5 minutes.
  Enemies now have increased health past a certain difficulty level.
  Buffed Combat Mech.
  Did you touch the wires? No? Good.
  Fixed some layering issues for background objects.
  Added new background objects.
  Uploaded the original project file. (Requires Scratch 2.0 or later to run.)
  And some more stuff I forgot about. Have fun.
  Probably fixed some bugs.
  
  V1.5
  
  Enemy interceptors use hit and run tactics now.
  Added the MK I Class C Interceptor: The same as the Prototype but more armour.
  Added the MK II Class C Interceptor: Same as the Protoype but with shielding and Rotary Autocannon armaments.
  Revamped ship selection interface
  Relabled every playable ship
  Removed PD turret holes from Railgun Corvette (Formally the MAC Battleship)
  Added particle effect for when the player's shields are depleted
  Changed ship and planet selection buttons to be a lot more obvious
  If you're wondering, the 'C' in the C class interceptor means Classic because the Prototype Corvette is the first non-placeholder ship made for the game. (There's some trivia for you.)
  Also, my personal preference is the Protoype Corvette
  You can now go back to ship selection and not be greeted with a visual mess
  Changed position of start mission button
  Kamakazi Drones no longer heal you (I got some math wrong.)
  
  V1.6
  
  In the works!
  
  Fixed MK I C Class Interceptor not being able to shoot.
  Title Screen has been updated to include the new spacecraft that were added before it.
  Title Screen has been updated to show Neptune instead of Saturn.

  Enemies now use thier alternative attack AI with siphon mission type.
  Siphon sprite changed and added 5th damage level.
  Fixed Pirated Hauler size.
  Added punctuation to changelog.
  Fixed Class C Interceptor MK I's rear section.
  Increased Siphon's max HP by 250.
  (Hopefully) fixed enemies drifting when approaching the player.
  I still don't really like the MK I C Class Interceptor.
  Enemies now attack the Siphon and Escort Target.
  Fixed sprites of MK I & II C Class Interceptors.

  (The assets for the alien drones & planet have been in the game since the release build btw.)
  Please note: The aliens are NO pushovers. They're tough AND aggressive. They also lay down lots of fire and have carrier support.
